## Splitbill - Money Management for Smart Groups and Smart Couples

This app uses a MERN stack to help groups or couples manage who needs to pay who in a time where borrowing money from your friends is more prevalent. Uses ranging from: how much do you owe the person who picked up the dinner tab, which roommate is going to pay for paper towels next grocery run, or why am I three hundred seventy-nine dollars and sixty-seven cents in debt to my girlfriend? This app solves it all.
